{sample program in TINY language -computes factorial or sum based on choice by user}

read x;{input an integer}

read choice;	{0 means compute sum, 1 means compute factorial}

if(choice=0) then result := 0 else result := 1 end;

repeat
	
	if(choice = 0) then
		result := result + x
	else
		result := result * x
	end;

	x := x - 1

until x = 0;

write result
