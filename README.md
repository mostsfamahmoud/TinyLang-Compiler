# TinyLang Compiler

## Overview
Welcome to the Scanner project, the first phase of our TINY language compiler! This program reads a TINY language snippet and generates a list of tokens, each represented by a token value and type, which are then saved to a file.

## Introduction

The Scanner is a crucial component that reads the source code, performing lexical analysis to break it into tokensâ€”the fundamental units of the programming language. This phase involves reading the source code character by character, identifying tokens using regular expressions, and creating corresponding entries in the symbol table for each token. The tokens are then passed to the parser for further processing.
